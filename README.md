# Tap'O'Meter App build with electron

```
used packages:
- electron
- electron-forge
- electron-forge-maker-portable
```

This repo does not contain build project!<br>
In order to build the app please refer to the electron docs at: https://www.electronjs.org/

<p>
  Personally i've injected forge config to create a portable .exe file
